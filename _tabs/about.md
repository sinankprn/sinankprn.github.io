## What I Do

I develop **data-driven solutions** that help sporting organisations make better decisions. My work sits at the intersection of **machine learning**, **sports science**, and **real-world application**—transforming complex datasets into actionable insights.

### PhD Research — Community Sport Analytics
*CSIRO Data61 & Rugby Australia*

Building predictive models to understand what makes community sports clubs thrive. My research directly informs how national sporting organisations allocate resources to **improve retention**, **grow participation**, and **ensure long-term sustainability** across thousands of clubs.

- Developing ML pipelines to analyse participation patterns across large-scale datasets
- Creating interpretable models that translate to practical resource allocation strategies
- Collaborating with industry partners to ensure research delivers measurable outcomes

### Applied AI Research — Elite Sport Performance
*NSW Institute of Sport (NSWIS)*

Leading the technical development of LLM-powered tools for coaches and athletes. Designing systems that **automate content analysis** and **accelerate insight generation** in high-performance sport environments.

- Architecting RAG systems for domain-specific knowledge retrieval
- Building automated analysis pipelines that reduce manual review time
- Deploying practical AI tools in real coaching workflows

## What Drives Me

I'm motivated by problems that demand both **technical depth** and **practical impact**. Over the past 18 months, I've developed a deep focus on Large Language Models—not just understanding how they work, but building applications that solve real problems.

My projects page showcases tools I've built: from **automated research paper aggregation** to **AI-powered document extraction** to **RAG-based knowledge systems**. Each project reflects my approach: identify a genuine need, build a working solution, and iterate based on real usage.

I thrive in environments where **rigorous research meets practical implementation**—where the goal isn't just to publish, but to build things that work.
