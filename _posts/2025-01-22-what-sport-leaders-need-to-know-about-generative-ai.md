## What Is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a type of AI that learns from large amounts of data and then uses what it learned to create new content. The new content is not a copy, but something similar in style or pattern to the original data. These models are trained on massive datasets using deep learning, and are often fine-tuned with human feedback to make their outputs more accurate, helpful, and safe.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of generative AI focused on text. They are versatile enough to write content, translate languages, summarise, and answer questions without needing specialised training for each task. In addition to text generation, many models support tool calling (calling external tools (like databases queries or API calls) and use results in their responses), structured output (where the model’s response is constrained to follow a defined format), multimodality (process and return data other than text, such as images, audio, and video), and reasoning (models perform multi-step reasoning to arrive at a conclusion). Different models excel at different tasks, some are better at following complex instructions, others at structured reasoning, and some support larger context windows for handling more information.

### Structured Output

Models can be requested to provide their response in a format matching a given schema. This is useful for ensuring the output can be easily parsed and used in subsequent processing.
